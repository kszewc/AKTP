This repository contain all files necessary recreate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results from publication "AI-Based Discovery and CryoEM Structural Elucidation of a
KATP Channel Pharmacochaperone" by ElSheikh, Shyng et al.

List of files:

Analysis.py  - Python script for MD data analysis

MD - folder with starting files for gromacs and with final frame for all 5 simulations (due to their sizes, MD trajectories are available upon request)
  run1-5.gro - final frames of 5 MD simulation repeats
  run1-5.gro - portable binary run input file. This file contains the starting structure of the simulation, the molecular topology and all the simulation parameters.
  step5_input_lig.gro - initial structure of the system (from charmm-gui + added AKATP ligand)
  step5_input_lig.pdb - initial structure of the system (from charmm-gui + added AKATP ligand)
  step7_production.mdp - MD parameters for gromacs
  topol.top - topology input for gromacs
  toppar - folder with all topology data needed for simulation
